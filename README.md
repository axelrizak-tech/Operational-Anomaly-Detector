# Operational-Anomaly-Detector
A small Python tool that automatically detects operational anomalies in CSV files.  Instead of manually scanning spreadsheets, the script highlights unusual costs, durations or volumes and explains why they are considered anomalies.  Designed as a lightweight decision-support solution for operations and finance teams.
